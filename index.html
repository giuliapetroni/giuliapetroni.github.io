            Even the safest neighborhood could be subject to crime, said police Sgt. Brian Berkovitz at the 19th District Chicago Alternative Policing Strategy meeting Thursday.
            </p>
            <p>
            Recent data statistics of robberies, burglaries and thefts occurred in the southeast area of <a href= "https://www.facebook.com/pages/Lake-View/1056017067862987">Lakeview</a>, revealed that citizens’ most common mistakes include leaving doors and windows unlocked, and walking alone at night without being aware of the surroundings, Berkovitz said.

            <q cite="http://michelleminkoff.com/2013/07/17/why-i-develop-in-the-newsroom/">If you’re not looking around and your head is in your phone, you’re an easy target. On the streets, especially at night, keep your heads up, and avoid getting distracted,</q> Berkovitz said to the participants. Residents should be constantly vigilant and act smart in preventing uncomfortable situation, he said.
            </p>
            <p>
            <q cite="http://michelleminkoff.com/2013/07/17/why-i-develop-in-the-newsroom/">The biggest resource to fight crime is actually this,</q> Berkovitz said of the community gathering.
            The idea behind <strong>community policing</strong> relies on the partnership between police and citizens to identify and solve neighborhood crime problems, he said.
            </p>
            <p>
            During the meeting, residents participated to the discussion by expressing their concerns and sharing their experiences. After hearing the screams of the woman robbed in West Oakdale Street in June, Jim Blankshain said he wants to know more about the legal proceedings that follow an arrest. He asked the officers the procedure a citizen has to follow to access information about a legal case.
            </p>
            <p>
            In order to exchange information, and create a relationship based on trust and accountability, police and residents of the <strong>19th District</strong> regularly meet twice a month at <a href= "http://www.secondunitarian.org/get-involved/join-2u/">the Second Unitarian Church</a>, police Officer Ron Tanaka said.
